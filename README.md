# Localstorage Task

## Explanation

- You can change html and JavaScript like you want.
- The goal is to store list of tasks in localstorage.

## How to do that (My idea)?

- Update localstorage after every form submit.
- Also update `task` variable - it should always have the same items that you have in localstorage.
- On initial page load, get informations from localstorage and then render the list of tasks.
